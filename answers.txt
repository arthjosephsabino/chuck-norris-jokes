2.	Please create a function which counts a character occurrence in a repeated string. 
On a given integer N, a lowercase string S and a search character C. 
The S string is repeated until reaches the length of N letters. 
The assignment is to find the number of occurrences of C in the final string. 

Write a function that receives the string S, the N letters to be repeated and returns the occurrences of the given C character. 
The code must be complied successfully. 
Example:
S = "abcd"
N = 11
C = ‘a’
Final String = "abcdabcdabc"
Result: 3 occurrences


answer:

function countCharOccurrence(S, N, C) {
  const sReps = Math.ceil(N / S.length);
  const str = S.repeat(sReps);
  const count = (str.match(new RegExp(C, "g")) || []).length;
  return count;
}

3.) SQL Query

answer:

SELECT 
    c.CampaignName AS "Campaign Name",
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.RoundID) AS "Rounds Count",
    COUNT(s.SegmentID) AS "Segments Count"
FROM 
    Campaigns c
LEFT JOIN 
    Rounds r ON c.CampaignID = r.CampaignID
LEFT JOIN 
    Segments s ON r.RoundID = s.RoundID
WHERE 
    c.CampaignName LIKE 'MyTestCampaign%'
GROUP BY 
    c.CampaignName
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.RoundID) >= 3
ORDER BY 
    "Rounds Count" DESC
LIMIT 10;

4.) summation

answer:

function summation(...args) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
      if (!isNaN(args[i])) {
          sum += args[i];
      }
  }
  return sum;
}
